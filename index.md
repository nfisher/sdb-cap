####Sandown Bay Resource Capital is a specialist mining private equity firm. 

#####We invest in mining companies globally and work with them to <strong>transform</strong> and <strong>build</strong> strong and sustainable businesses.

Sandown Bay was founded by senior mining industry professionals with decades of experience working with 
the worldâ€™s largest mining companies. Our team has a long history of acquiring, developing and operating 
mining assets globally and creating value for all stakeholders. 

Our investment focus is on the junior mining sector1, which has been most impacted by the significant 
contraction in valuations and availability of capital. Our primary investment objective is to work with 
management teams and stakeholders to optimise mining assets and deliver positive returns throughout the 
full commodity cycle.
